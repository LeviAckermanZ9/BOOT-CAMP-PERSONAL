Deep Q-Learning (DQL) is an advanced form of Q-Learning that incorporates deep neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, which is used in reinforcement learning to determine the best actions to take in various states. Here's a detailed breakdown with notes and sample code to get you started.

### Notes on Deep Q-Learning

1. **Q-Learning Basics**:
    - Q-Learning is a value-based reinforcement learning algorithm that seeks to learn the value of a state-action pair (Q-values).
    - The Q-value update rule is: 
      \[
      Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \right]
      \]
      where:
      - \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.
      - \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.
      - \( r \) is the reward received after taking action \( a \) in state \( s \) and moving to state \( s' \).
      - \( \max_{a'} Q(s', a') \) is the maximum Q-value for the next state \( s' \).

2. **Deep Q-Learning (DQL)**:
    - DQL uses a neural network to approximate the Q-value function.
    - The network takes the state as input and outputs Q-values for all possible actions.
    - The loss function used in training is typically the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted Q-values and the target Q-values:
      \[
      \text{Loss} = \left[ r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a'; \theta') - Q(s, a; \theta) \right]^2
      \]
      where \( \theta \) are the parameters of the Q-network and \( \theta' \) are the parameters of the target Q-network.

3. **Experience Replay**:
    - To stabilize training, DQL uses experience replay, a technique where the agent's experiences (state, action, reward, next state) are stored in a replay buffer.
    - Mini-batches of experiences are sampled from the buffer to train the Q-network, which helps break the correlation between consecutive experiences.

4. **Target Network**:
    - A separate target network is used to generate the target Q-values, which is updated less frequently to provide a stable target during training.
    - The target network parameters \( \theta' \) are periodically updated with the Q-network parameters \( \theta \).

### Deep Q-Learning Code

Here's a simple implementation of Deep Q-Learning using Python and PyTorch:

```python
import gym
import numpy as np
import random
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from collections import deque

# Neural Network for Q-Learning
class QNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, state_size, action_size):
        super(QNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(state_size, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, action_size)
    
    def forward(self, state):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(state))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        return self.fc3(x)

# Hyperparameters
state_size = 4
action_size = 2
learning_rate = 0.001
gamma = 0.99
epsilon_start = 1.0
epsilon_end = 0.01
epsilon_decay = 0.995
buffer_size = 100000
batch_size = 64
update_target_every = 5

env = gym.make('CartPole-v1')
q_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
target_network = QNetwork(state_size, action_size)
target_network.load_state_dict(q_network.state_dict())
optimizer = optim.Adam(q_network.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)
replay_buffer = deque(maxlen=buffer_size)

def select_action(state, epsilon):
    if random.random() < epsilon:
        return env.action_space.sample()
    state = torch.FloatTensor(state).unsqueeze(0)
    with torch.no_grad():
        q_values = q_network(state)
    return np.argmax(q_values.numpy())

def train():
    if len(replay_buffer) < batch_size:
        return
    batch = random.sample(replay_buffer, batch_size)
    states, actions, rewards, next_states, dones = zip(*batch)

    states = torch.FloatTensor(states)
    actions = torch.LongTensor(actions)
    rewards = torch.FloatTensor(rewards)
    next_states = torch.FloatTensor(next_states)
    dones = torch.FloatTensor(dones)

    current_q_values = q_network(states).gather(1, actions.unsqueeze(1)).squeeze(1)
    with torch.no_grad():
        max_next_q_values = target_network(next_states).max(1)[0]
    target_q_values = rewards + (gamma * max_next_q_values * (1 - dones))

    loss = nn.MSELoss()(current_q_values, target_q_values)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

epsilon = epsilon_start
episodes = 1000
for episode in range(episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    done = False
    while not done:
        action = select_action(state, epsilon)
        next_state, reward, done, _ = env.step(action)
        replay_buffer.append((state, action, reward, next_state, done))
        state = next_state
        train()
    if episode % update_target_every == 0:
        target_network.load_state_dict(q_network.state_dict())
    epsilon = max(epsilon_end, epsilon * epsilon_decay)
    print(f"Episode {episode}, Epsilon: {epsilon:.2f}")

env.close()
```

### Key Components

1. **QNetwork Class**:
    - Defines a simple feedforward neural network with three fully connected layers.

2. **Hyperparameters**:
    - Various hyperparameters like state size, action size, learning rate, discount factor, and others are defined.

3. **Environment and Networks**:
    - Gym environment `CartPole-v1` is used.
    - Both Q-network and target network are instantiated.

4. **Action Selection**:
    - `select_action` function selects actions using an epsilon-greedy policy.

5. **Training Function**:
    - `train` function handles the experience replay and updates the Q-network.

6. **Main Training Loop**:
    - The main loop runs through episodes, collecting experiences, training the network, and periodically updating the target network.

This is a basic implementation and can be extended with techniques like Double DQN, Dueling DQN, Prioritized Experience Replay, etc., for improved performance.
